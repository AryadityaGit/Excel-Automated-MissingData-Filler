Purpose: Define the functional vision, architecture, and business context.

# Sections:
 1. Overview / Objective
 2. Problem statement (manual data filling → costly, error-prone)
 3. Proposed solution (automated cross-day lookup via VBA)
 4. Functional requirements (folder traversal, configurable columns, file filtering, control panel UI)
 5. Non-functional requirements (speed, portability, safety, maintainability)
 6. Success metrics (time saved per file, error reduction, adoption rate)
